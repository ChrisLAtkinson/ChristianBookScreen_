# LGBTQ Book Identifier

A Streamlit-based web app that identifies LGBTQ themes in book titles by analyzing synopses fetched using the [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/). The app processes a list of book titles provided via a CSV file and determines whether they contain LGBTQ-related content based on predefined keywords.

## Features

- Upload a CSV file with a column named **Title** containing book titles.
- Fetch book synopses using the Google Search API (powered by SerpAPI).
- Analyze synopses for LGBTQ keywords such as *gay*, *lesbian*, *transgender*, etc.
- View and download the results in a CSV format.

---

## How It Works

1. **Input Your API Key**: Provide your [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) key to enable Google search functionality.
2. **Upload a CSV File**: Upload a file with a `Title` column containing the book titles you want to analyze.
3. **Run Analysis**: The app fetches book synopses and searches for LGBTQ-related keywords.
4. **Download Results**: View the analysis results directly in the app and download them as a CSV file.

1. **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher
2. **Required Libraries**:
   - `streamlit`
   - `pandas`

## Limitations

- The app relies on the accuracy of Google Search results for synopses.
- Results may vary depending on the book's popularity and the quality of fetched data.
- You need a valid SerpAPI key with sufficient quota for the app to function.
